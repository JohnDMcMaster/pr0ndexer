fs: starting frequency

How to determine starting frequency?
Driver: PMC VS series
    Current: FIXME
Motor: 17PM-K318-04V
    17PM-K3** => L: 38 (1.50)
    17PM-K3 seem to have:
        rotor inertia: 50 g cm**2
        Detent torque: 11.3 mNm
No idea what load on shaft is
So lets just make up some numbers because why not
200 steps / rev
I know that 370 steps/second is a stable (1.85 RPS => 111.6 RPM)
And arbitrarily say that we can accelerate/decelerate to max speed in 0.25 second

Targetting delays down to 2,000, say up to 100x that...200,000
Don't want steps longer than say 100 ms certainly

stepvel = k / halfstep
370 = k / 2000, k = 740000
stepvel = 740000 / halfstep

Say limit to 10 steps / second min:
halfstep = 740000 / 10 = 74000

370 steps/s over 0.25s = 1480 steps/s**2

    Using 195 gives us error of:

    errror = 2000 - 1962.5 = 37.5
    since this is less than a step increase doesn't really matter
    large error probably from doing the multiplications

    with only 200 elements this is much faster and probably less space
